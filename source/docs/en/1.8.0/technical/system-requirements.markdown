System requirements
===================

## Hardware

The following is the minimum level of hardware HandBrake formally supports.

- Processor:
  - AMD Ryzen, Threadripper, or Epyc
  - Intel Core (6th generation and newer) i3, i5, i7, i9, or equivalent Xeon
  - Apple Silicon M1 and newer, recent Intel Macs supported per the above
- Free memory:
  - Depends on settings used but as a general guide:
  - 1 GB for transcoding standard definition video (480p/576p)
  - 2 to 8 GB for transcoding high definition video (720p/1080p)
  - 6 to 16 GB or more for transcoding ultra high definition video (2160p 4K)
- System storage:
  - 150 MB for the HandBrake app
- Display resolution:
  - 1280x960 minimum, proportionately higher with display scaling. (See section below)

While it may be technically possible to run HandBrake on hardware not meeting these requirements, it is not recommended. 

<!-- .system-windows -->
### Notice: Users with Intel CPU's

If you are running a 13th or 14th generation Intel CPU, please make sure you are running the latest BIOS to avoid system stability issues. 

If you are using Windows 10 and also have an Intel 12th generation CPU (or newer), we recommend using the "High Performance" power profile in Windows.

This should help maintain performance when HandBrake is not a foreground window. 

This should not be necessary if you are running Windows 11.

#### Other

While no official support for other systems is provided, HandBrakeâ€™s Flatpak binaries are widely compatible, and documentation is provided for compiling from source on a variety of BSDs and Linux distributions. Hardware encoding support may be limited or unavailable on these systems.

See [Where to get HandBrake](../get-handbrake/where-to-get-handbrake.html), [Building HandBrake for BSD](../developer/build-bsd.html), and [Building HandBrake for Linux](../developer/build-linux.html), for additional details.

### Windows

HandBrake requires [.NET Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0/runtime) 8.0.x.
Please becareful when selecting hte correct version to download. See the links under the "Run Desktop Apps" section in hte middle of the page!


| Windows Version | Status              | Last Compatible Version | Notes                        |
|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| Windows 11      | Supported           |                         |                              |
| Windows 10      | Supported           |                         | 1909 or later.               |

### Display scaling

Display scaling beyond 100% requires a proportionately higher resolution to fit the higher density interface graphics in the same physical space. For example, HandBrake will fit within the bounds of a 1920x1080 HD resolution display at 100% and 125% scaling, but not at 150% and higher.

Customization to system themes, such as font sizes and padding, may also impact the ability of the window to render in the space provided. 

If HandBrake does not fit within the bounds of your display, you can try changing the *Scale and Layout* setting on Windows, or the *Scaling Factor* setting on Linux, to a smaller value.
