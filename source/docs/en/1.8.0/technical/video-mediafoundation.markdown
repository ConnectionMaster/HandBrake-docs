Media Foundation
==================

## Supported hardware

- Windows 10 for ARM with Qualcomm ARM processors. This encoder will not display on x86 based systems.

## Enabling support

If your computer is supported you will see one or more of the following video encoders added to the encoder control on the `Video` tab.

- H.264 (MediaFoundation)
- H.265 (MediaFoundation)

## Presets

The following presets are available under the 'Hardware' category in the presets menu:

- H.265 MF 2160P 4K
- H.265 MF 1080p

These are a good starting point for configuring HandBrake to use these encoders.

## Performance

Only video encoding is performed by the hardware encoder. Every stage prior to and after video encoding including decoding, filters, audio/video sync, audio encoding, muxing, etc., is performed by the CPU. As a result, it is normal to have high (even 100%) CPU utilisation during encodes.

It is common, particularly on lower-end hardware, for the CPU to be a bottleneck for the hardware video encoder. To minimize this effect, disable any filters that you do not require.

## Advanced options

There are no advanced options available for VideoToolbox encoders.
